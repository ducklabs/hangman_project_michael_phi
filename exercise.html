<h1>Programming Exercise</h1>
As part of our interviewing process, we are asking potential candidates
to spend <b>up to four hours</b> on a programming exercise.&nbsp; We
understand that spending four hours developing a simple application
may not give us a thorough understanding of your programming
skills.&nbsp; Even though this is small application, please treat it as
if it were going to grow into a large system, maintained by a team of
developers. We value correctness and
robustness above everything else.<br>
<br>
Complete as much of the application as you can and approach it as though you would any project you were starting out on.<br>
<h2>Hangman</h2>Create a simple version of the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_%28game%29">Hangman</a>,
where the computer chooses a word within a chosen theme and the user
tries to guess it by suggesting letters.&nbsp; Feel free to use any
theme you want.&nbsp; We're assuming you've played it, but if not, let us know</a> and we can flush out the requirements a little more. We've included <a href="hang.zip">images</a> that you can use so that you don't have to spend any time building them.<br>
<br>
The following mockup is for illustration purposes only, please feel free to change it however you like.<br>
